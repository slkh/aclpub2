Dear COLING 2025 Participants,\\

We are happy to welcome you to the 31st International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2025), hosted in vibrant Abu Dhabi, the heart of Artificial Intelligence (AI), innovation, and culture in the United Arab Emirates. \\

COLING 2025 brings together the brightest minds in AI and Computational Linguistics, creating an unparalleled opportunity for dialogue and innovation. As language technology continues to redefine the way humans interact with machines, we are looking forward to exploring how these advancements can be leveraged to solve regional and global challenges—from healthcare and education to business and beyond.\\

Abu Dhabi offers a unique blend of tradition and modernity. From the awe-inspiring architecture of the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque to the cutting-edge developments on Saadiyat Island, the iconic Louvre Abu Dhabi, and the bustling cultural hub of Qasr Al Hosn, the city reflects the values of connectivity, learning, and exploration—values that resonate deeply with our scientific community.\\

As local chairs, our aim has been to create an environment where attendees can engage in meaningful discussions, form new collaborations, and experience the warmth of Emirati hospitality. We are proud to showcase our region’s dedication to technology and language innovation through the conference program, which features distinguished keynote speakers, dynamic workshops, and opportunities to explore diverse linguistic and cultural insights.\\

We encourage you to take advantage of this exceptional location, not only by participating in the academic program but also by immersing yourself in the cultural richness of Abu Dhabi. Whether you visit the Louvre Abu Dhabi, stroll along the Corniche, or sample traditional Arabic cuisine, we hope you leave with memories that extend far beyond the conference halls.\\

With this in mind, we have prepared excursions that showcase the best of Abu Dhabi’s culture, history, and adventure: (i) for history enthusiasts, a visit to the Abrahamic House \& Louvre Abu Dhabi, (ii) for architecture and culture lovers, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque \& Qasr Al Watan (Presidential Palace), and (iii) for adventure seekers, dune bashing, sand surfing, and camel riding. All three excursions conclude with a traditional Arabic dinner in the desert.\\

The logo for COLING 2025, designed by Professor Nizar Habash from NYUAD \& MBZUAI, showcases the architectural marvels of Abu Dhabi, UAE. It features, from left to right, seven iconic buildings, including the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, Capital Gate, aka leaning tower of Abu Dhabi (near our conference location), Etihad Towers, Burj Mohammed bin Rashid, Al Bahr Twin Towers, and Aldar Headquarters Building.\\

As the local organizer of COLING 2025, Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), the world’s first specialized research-based AI university, we are glad to see for the first time this prestigious conference to be held in the MENA region. This is a notable milestone for the region, following the successful 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), which was organized by NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) in partnership with MBZUAI.\\

COLING 2025 is a dynamic platform for showcasing Abu Dhabi’s growing leadership in AI, especially in natural language processing. Abu Dhabi is the home of MBZUAI’s Institute of Foundation Models, which has developed: Jais, in collaboration with G42 and Cerebras, the world’s leading open Arabic-centric foundation and instruction-tuned large language model; K2 a 65B model optimized for reasoning; Nanda, the world’s best open Hindi model; and LLM360, the first truly open LLM. It is also the home of TII, which has developed the Falcon family of LLMs.\\

Being in the MENA region, there is a special focus of COLING 2025 on local languages. In addition to the main conference, the tutorials, and the workshops, we further host the First Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) Winter School, a two-day event (sponsored by NYUAD, with the first day hosted in MBZUAI). The Winter School is designed to advance knowledge and skills in Arabic NLP research and development and to foster interdisciplinary exchange and networking among students, academics, and industry professionals in the field.\\

In addition to leveraging Abu Dhabi’s strong MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) infrastructure and capabilities, the conference is supported by the Abu Dhabi Convention and Exhibition Bureau (ADCEB), part of the Department of Tourism and Culture – Abu Dhabi (DCT Abu Dhabi).\\

In closing, we hope that you will enjoy your stay in Abu Dhabi, exploring its rich culture, taking advantage of the many opportunities for fun, all while getting the most out of the extensive technical program of COLING 2025.\\

Welcome to COLING 2025 and welcome to the vibrant city of Abu Dhabi!\\

\<حياكم في داركم> Hayyakum fi Darkum `Welcome to our shared home’.\\
