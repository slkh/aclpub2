Diversity \& Inclusion, both in terms of approaches and participation, are an integral part of who COLING is as a community. To find out more about the unique history of the COLING series of conferences visit: \url{https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/iccl} \\

COLING’2025 is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free environment for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to attendees, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger COLING 2022 community of organizers, volunteers and participants through events or interactions.\\
Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks, IRC chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying behavior are expected to comply immediately.\\

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of COLING’2025 may take reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from mailing lists, discussion boards and other electronic communications channels or expulsion from the event to resolve the issue.\\
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from any member of Local Organization Committee. Please be assured that your concerns will be kept in strict confidence, and we will consult with you on any actions taken.\\
